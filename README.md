本算法对源文使用ascii表进行轮替，加密效果由密钥的组成和长度决定。对于一段密文，给出不同的密钥会得到不同的解，只有正确的密钥才能得到正确的解。更适合处理具有大量文本信息的数据，对base64结果进行二次加密也有很好效果。
密钥不能是同一个字符组成，长度不能低于4，6以上效果更好。

This algorithm uses ASCII table to rotate the source text, and the encryption effect is determined by the composition and length of the key. For a ciphertext, giving different keys will get different solutions. Only the correct key can get the correct solution. It is more suitable for processing data with a large amount of text information, and the secondary encryption of Base64 results also has a good effect.
The key cannot be composed of the same character, and the length cannot be less than 4 or 6. The effect is better.
